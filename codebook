In this study, subjects performed each of six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying).  Each of the subjects (1-30) is represented by a separate row.  The values in the data frame represent the average values that were obtained from a particular subject for a given activity.  These average values were derived from the dataset from the following source:

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012


In order to process the data, the code: 1) binds together file info that identifies subject and activity for all of the collected data; 2) more specifically labels the dataset so that all testing variables and activities are made explicit; 3) subsets out the variables that refer to means or standard deviation calculations from the data; and 4) generates a new dataset where means are calculated for each subject and each activity.
